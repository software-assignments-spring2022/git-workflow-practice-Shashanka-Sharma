## Summary
What I found interesting about this article is the idea of computing with conscience. Unfortunately, in today's society the applications of computer science typically tend to be geared towards advertising to consumers and the centralization of data. Computer science is such a wonderful and powerful tool that can be applied to genuinely benefit people's lives, but a huge portion of the job market revolves around exploting user data. Web3 and decentralization allows a new means of creating applications. There are flaws with the current means of using Web3, but the potential of the technology is too big to ignore. Adoption is what is necessary and improvements upon the technology can allow people to use the computing power at our hands in a more wholesome manner. 

## Vincent Cheng's comment
I agree that in modern day's software, the focus seems to be the exploitation of the users. Especially with 
social medias and e-commerce, users' data are constantly are at jeopardy to a certain companies. I defeinitely 
see that there is resistance to this through the development of blockchain and de-centralized technology, but 
I believe that this resistance movement is also being exploited by a certain groups to their benefits.
